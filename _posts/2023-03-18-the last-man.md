My dearest Jane,

I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since I last wrote to you. In fact, it's been weeks since I last heard from anyone on Earth. I'm sorry for my silence, but I've been through so much that it's difficult to put it into words. 

I'm still up here in the International Space Station, all alone. It's hard to believe that just a few weeks ago, there were so many of us here, working, talking to each other, sharing joy and pain. And now, there is nothing, except a stark void, a silence so loud it's deafening. 

We were a team of 6, us astronauts. Sent to study a strange shining disc that was encircling around the Earth. It appeared to be a fascinating mission. A chance to make first contact with extra terrestrial beings too, I presume. A chance to make history. We were happy.

Alas! If only I knew what was going to happen. I curse the day I signed up for the mission. I wish I was there, with you that day walking our daughter to school rather than coming to Nevada for this mission. I guess we can't really control our fate, can we? 

I don't know what you experienced from down there in Earth. But within a few days after we were in orbit aboard the ISS, we saw a trail of lightning, a din so bright it lit up the insides of our spaceship. It had originated from that strange object, and went towards the earth. Lasted for a few seconds, that. We were unaware of what had happened at the time. But came to know about it pretty soon the next day.

From what we could compute and gather, the lightning we saw was a cosmic ray, so powerful that it jammed, fried and corrupted over half of the electronics and telecommunication network over the globe. I don't know why it didn't fail equipment on the ISS. Perhaps the beings on the object didn't want that? 

Communication failure soon led to chaos and misinformation. It started with the earth blacking out into darkness. We lost groumd control within a few days. Countries started firing and misfiring missiles onto each other. And finally the nuclear war. Mushroom clouds sprouting up everywhere. The earth seemed to be shrouded with a grey cloud. Even the north and south poles were nowhere to be seen, completely melted. 

We were so helpless Jane. So helpless up here. 

Since then, things have been getting progressively worse up here. We're running out of supplies and oxygen, and the paranoia is slowly driving us mad. I've seen things that I can't explain, and I know my team-mates have too.

There was an incident a few days ago where one of my team-mates started acting strangely. He was convinced that someone was out to get him, that there was a conspiracy among us. I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn't listen. Then, in a moment of madness, he attacked another team-mate with a wrench. It was brutal, and I had to intervene before he killed the poor guy.

After that, the atmosphere on board the ISS was tense, to say the least. We were all on edge, and it didn't take much to set us off. One of my other team-mates became obsessed with the idea that someone was stealing our supplies. He started hoarding food and water, and eventually, he too turned on the rest of us. I won't go into the details of what happened next, but suffice it to say that he didn't make it out alive.

I don't know how I've managed to hold on to my sanity through all of this. I think about you and our daughter every day, and that gives me some comfort.I'm not proud of what I had to do to survive, but I had no choice. I had to stay sane, for myself and for our daughter.  I try to remain focused, optimistic that help would come soon.

But it's hard, Jane. It's so hard.

The strange object we were sent here to study, the one that's been encircling the Earth, it's getting closer and closer. I can see it from the windows of the ISS. It seems like a pendulum, taunting me, a constant reminder of my own mortality.

We had such big plans, didn't we? We talked about buying a house in the countryside and settling down with our baby girl. We dreamed of a peaceful life, away from the chaos of the world. Growing old together. 

But I've made my peace with it now. I know that I can't hold on much longer. 

It's been a few minutes I have turned off the oxygen supply. I feel dizzy, lightheaded. It's a peaceful way to go I guess. I hope that you and our daughter will take some comfort in that.

Please know that I love you both more than anything in this world, and that I'm sorry that I couldn't come back to you. If by some miracle you're still alive, I hope that you can find happiness in this new world. If not, I know that I'll be joining you both soon, and that thought gives me some comfort.

Forever yours, in this life and the next,

Karl
