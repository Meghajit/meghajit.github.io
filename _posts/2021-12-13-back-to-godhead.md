I feel a gentle, cool breeze touch against my face. I try to open my eyes, but they seem stuck. The air smells
wonderful, like freshly cut oranges with a hint of jasmine. I feel light, without any baggage, nothing keeping me to the
ground, floating as if. I feel naked, but that doesn't trouble me. I feel at peace, my mind calm, no thoughts rushing
through. The sound of water, splashing, trickling, gurgling reaches my ears. Waves rising and falling gently. I can feel
a gargantuan expanse all around me, of infinite depths. It surrounds me, making me feel its colossal vastness. Its
intimidating, yet humbling at the same time. I feel scared, but protected.

Suddenly, I feel something warm radiating all over my body. I feel bathed by it, cleansing me of everything. It has the
warmth of the morning sun, but the coolness of the midnight moon. It soothes, but doesn't burn.

I feel a Hand rest on top of my head. The very moment, jolts of electricity runs through my body. Starting from my eyes,
it passes through my neck and spine, down to my chest. I feel my heart racing, its thumping even though strong, slowing
down gradually. The current continues on downwards, passing through my belly, my legs and ultimately ending at my toe. I
feel short of breath, my eyes still closed, my senses slowly fading away. I start to paralyze, losing control of my own
body. It's terrifying. Tears build up in my eyes. But strangely enough I don't resist. All this while, the Hand still
rests on my head, calming me, accompanying me in this ordeal. As my heart stops beating, I feel a strange sensation. A
ball of fire, starts to rise inside my body. It originates right below my abdomen, churning and burning my insides. It
slowly starts to ascend, through my lungs and throat, and ultimately comes out of my mouth. What's happening to me?

I feel different now. My consciousness seems to be far more alive. I feel free, invigorated. I seem to occupy no space,
yet I feel as vast as my surroundings. I feel powerful, yet humble. I can take up any shape I want, yet I seem to be
free flowing, light as the wind.

As I rise up, my vision seems to have been restored. I can see everything now. A great blue ocean of water, extending
till the horizons. Its calmness giving me a sense of peace. Small waves crash against each other. I don't know why, but
I try to see my own reflection in the water. I see nothing except a glowing mass of fire, bright and burning; so bright
that I can't stare at it for long. It seems to be radiating some sort of energy, some kind of glowing aura. What have I
changed into?

As I look the other way, I see an amazing sight. A giant ball of white light, infinitely brighter than myself, floating
on top of the blue water. I can't look at it. It's too bright. It seems to be radiating the same brightness as me, only
much stronger. I slowly start to float towards it. It's not voluntary, just that I feel it's the right thing to do. The
Fire seems to be calling me. It's like a child hearing his mother's lullaby to sleep, or how a bee is attracted to a
flower; it has no language but its universal. I feel a sense of purity and calmness come inside me. It's like I am
finally free, free from suffering, free from illness, free from death. No one can hurt me now. No one.

As I rise up, I look backwards, trying to catch a glimpse of my own self, the Body from which I came out. It's now
floating lifeless on top of the water. As I watch, it starts disintegrating into dust. A strong gust of wind arrives and
the ashes sway away. Away into nothingness. A lifetime of happiness, pain, suffering, jealousy, love, hate, all
culminated into Death.

As I look forward again. I am dazed by a wonderful sight. Millions. No. Probably Billions. I am surrounded by billions
of small balls of fire, all shining brightly with the same radiance as me. All of us surrounding the Great Ball of White
Light in the middle and slowly merging into it. As I begin my journey into the Infinite, I lose my consciousness. I feel
the vastness consuming me, engulfing me in a warm embrace. Happiness reigning supreme, I feel finally at peace.

The son has returned to his mother.

The drop has found its Ocean.

The devotee has found his Lord.

I have become Him and He has become me.
